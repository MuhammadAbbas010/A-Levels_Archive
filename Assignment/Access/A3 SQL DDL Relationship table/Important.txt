The program already works due to use of manual method to get two SQL keys, however an SQL DDL and DML method 
would include the following code to execute it under a new query called Alter_Order_Product


/*
for  Alter_Order_product

 ALTER TABLE Order_Product_Table
Add PRIMARY KEY (Order_ID);
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Customer_ID FOREIGN KEY (Customer_ID) REFERENCES Order_Table (Customer_ID int);
