## Chapter 4 


The Von Neumann architecture uses a single processor which follows a linear sequences of fetch-decode-execute. This means that is follows a line by line sequence when executing the code. 
Though this has a problem when large amounts of instructions are to be processed but it has to run through line by line before it reaches the end, this is called the “Von Neumann bottleneck”.

Question: The Neumann architecture is a system which includes a RAM component in between of the CPU and the hard disk of the computer which serves as a temporary memory storage. It is focused on using a single processor and follows a linear sequence for the fetch-decode-execute cycle. 

The Registers and the Fetch decode execute cycle, the program counter holds the address of the next instruction to be executed and the PC (program counter) automatically increments. 

System of Boost clock speed is the internal clock speed of the computer which helps it to sync it’s functions and processes and control and manage the speed of the operations being performed.

Lesson 2

Operations:
-	Input: IN
-	Output: Out

Arithmetic:
-	ADD
-	SUB

Unconditional and Conditional Instructions

Conditional
-	JPE 
-	JPN
Unconditional
-	JMP
CMP is used to compare two numbers (or any other type of data). 

Exercise 1:

DECLARE Bill: Integer 
Input Bill
IF Bill >= 100
	Bill  Bill + 0.80

END IF
OUTPUT Bill 

Low-level Language
The .START at the beginning is called a directive, if an instruction has a full stop before it then we know it’s a directive. 
 
Exercise 2:
i)	LDA
ii)	ADD
iii)	JPE
